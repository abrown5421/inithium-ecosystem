// A `mongodb+srv://` URI (MongoDB Atlas's default connection string format) resolves via a DNS
// SRV lookup before the driver ever opens a socket. Node's own DNS resolver trusts whatever the
// OS network adapter reports as its configured server - on a machine where that's been left
// pointing at a local resolver stub (127.0.0.1, common leftover config from VPN clients or
// DNS-filtering tools, even once disconnected/uninstalled) with nothing actually listening there,
// every SRV query fails with ECONNREFUSED even though the OS's own DNS tools (which fall back
// differently) resolve fine - see connectDatabase's own error if this ever regresses. Pointing
// Node's resolver at public DNS directly sidesteps that broken local config without touching the
// OS network settings at all.
